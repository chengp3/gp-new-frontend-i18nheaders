It will take 3 class periods for most learners. Students dive in with a data literacy puzzle, which we call a “Polymath Puzzle.” Students are given a figure from a current scientific study on barn swallows (a common bird across the world), but with text elements coded with an alphabetic shift (e.g. each letter is shifted: A to B, B to C, and so on). They have to work in teams (or individually) to decipher the messages, and then try to understand the figure. This is a high-level data literacy task that piques students’ natural love of puzzle-solving, while working on GRIT/grappling and the [21st Century Skills (4 Cs) Goals](https://www.aeseducation.com/blog/four-cs-21st-century-skills). Videos guide students through each stage of the polymath puzzle. In Periods 2 and 3, students create and interpret histograms from the same data, allowing for a deeper understanding of the pros and cons of scatter plots and histograms for visualizing data patterns. The culminating task is for students to synthesize the conclusions from the two figures with presented facts to hypothesize a reason for why female song has been missed until 2020 in this widely studied species."},{"__component":"lesson-plan.procedure","id":4,"SectionTitle":"Procedure and Time Chunking","LessonDuration":"Estimated 3 x 45 min periods","Chunks":"#### Timing Notes\n\n- This lesson will likely take 3 full 45min class periods for most groups of students, though upper-level high schoolers may finish both days in a single period.\n- The Google Slide Presentation (see materials) guides the lesson flow and does not rely on deep subject-matter understanding.\n- The lesson stimulates student-inquiry and creative problem solving, following a 5E instructional model. The 5Es are indicated in parentheses below.\n\n### Day 1\n##### Stage I. The “Nearly Impossible Task” Mystery Hook (5E: Engage & Explore)  \n\n\n#### 1. Introduction:\n![seg_1of6.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/galactic-polymath/image/upload/v1614548921/seg_1of6_a15a60686b.png)\n\nTeacher instructs students to work on their own or in groups to decipher the alphabetic shift. (See Lesson Preview for a walkthrough on strategies). Make sure not to mention anything about what the study is about!\n\n\n\n#### 2. Hook:\n![seg_2of6.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/galactic-polymath/image/upload/v1614548921/seg_2of6_fc645fa7b0.png)\nStudents decipher the Polymath Puzzle as an engagement hook for this challenging data literacy task.\na.   Students work in groups to determine alphabetic shift  there are multiple approaches to this. See videos in  Preview presentation to see an explanation.\nb.   Students decode labels in graph\nc.   Students attempt to interpret the figure.\n\nIf they are having trouble, ask them to notice everything they can about the figure (axes, patterns, differences). You want them to pay attention in particular to differences in song production across the sexes. Whatever the males are (they may think they’re humans, birds, or whales), they sing more (almost all male points are higher than females on the y-axis). Males also sing for a longer period of time (males sing throughout the breeding season, while females stop singing at the end of May (when they lay eggs; though one cannot\n\n#### 3. Clarify procedure/scaffolding:\n![seg_3of6.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/galactic-polymath/image/upload/v1614548921/seg_3of6_430a83c0aa.png)\n\nShow the video (embedded in presentation) explaining the cipher and different strategies students might have adopted to solve it. Invite them to share challenges and how they overcame them. This is a great opportunity to stress the importance of creativity, collaboration, and grit for problem solving.\n\n#### 4. Hypothesize about the graph:\n![seg_4of6.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/galactic-polymath/image/upload/v1614548921/seg_4of6_bc702e8355.png)\n\nIn live/in-person classes, invite students to discuss their observations about the graph and hypotheses for what the figure means. If no one is volunteering, consider having students write responses and provide them to you digitally or on scraps of paper. Encourage creative, or detailed observations without giving away who is right. Gently redirect students who seem to be off-track by asking them questions. Important to encourage good questions, logic, and worry less about accuracy, modelling inquiry and growth mindset.\n\n\n#### 5. Mystery Reveal:\n![seg_5of6.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/galactic-polymath/image/upload/v1614548921/seg_5of6_0f8a70bace.png)\n\nShow the “reveal” video in the presentation. The video shows the lead author of the birdsong study discussing the background of the figure and how the data was collected. Debrief with students to assess learning and engagement. Ask them what this left them more curious about.\n\n#### 6. Pivot to Histograms:\n![seg_6of6.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/galactic-polymath/image/upload/v1614548921/seg_6of6_8fbc7f86a4.png)\n\nStudents learn about how an anonymous scientist disagreed about the use of the scatter plot to visualize the data, and suggested to use a histogram. Great opportunity to connect with other lessons on peer review, though this lesson focuses on how data visuals all have pros and cons and how choice of visuals affects how well readers/viewers are able to perceive patterns in the data. Major point: data visuals can be as rich as a written text in telling a story about the world.

Barn swallows are one of the most common birds in the world and have been the subject of more than 1000 studies, yet published birding field guides and scientific papers have all failed to describe female song or they describe it incorrectly as being the same as male song (females have their own song type). This is an important oversight, because research on male bird song has informed a lot of theory in biology about how populations evolve through mate choice and competition involving vocal communication, and how new species form. \n\nIgnoring the sounds females make may result from inherent biases. Since bird song became an area of scientific study in the 1800s, it was almost exclusively researched by white males in the Northern Hemisphere. Since women have become welcomed into all areas of science, and research institutions have focused more intent study in tropical regions of the world, studies have discovered that female song is the ancestral state (i.e. the ancestor of all living song birds had both singing males and females). Moreover, female song has not been entirely lost in most species. As in the barn swallow, natural selection has favored females that sing less often, and to have more concise songs that are often restricted to the pre-egg-laying part of the breeding season. This drop in female singing after egg-laying is thought to stem from trying not to draw predators to nests. Due to lack of study, the full function of song in competition among females, male mate choice, or other functions is not well understood in most species.\n\nFurther Reading: \n- [Female birds sing.

Students explore one of the primary figures in the study, a scatter plot (graph) showing different patterns of male and female singing output over the breeding season. Importantly, males sang much more than females and for a longer time (May-Aug, rather than just May). Thus, because males sing more frequently, if we assume (as has been common for birders and scientists until recently) that only males sing, your assumptions are reinforced more easily, because you are less likely to see a female sing.\n\nDuring the peer review process, an anonymous scientist suggested that the scatter plot was not a good way to represent the data, instead suggesting that the authors should have displayed a histogram. In Periods 2 and 3 of the lesson, students aggregate (combine) the authentic study data in order to create a histogram. They must then interpret the data in both formats (deepening their understanding of how histograms and scatter plots relate to each other), and conclude which is a better way to demonstrate the study’s findings, explaining why.\n\nFor further reflection, students are then asked to synthesize what they have learned, along with new information presented to them. Why has female song been missed? Partially because of a pre-existing assumption that females don't sing, along with less common singing behavior in females. Why do females sing less? Because natural selection favors females who sing less. Females must sit on eggs for around 2 weeks, leaving them open to predation. If they were to sing as loudly and provocatively as males, they would attract predators which would eat them or their eggs, passing on no genes. Thus, natural selection has likely caused female song to be lost, simplified, or to be produced for short time periods during establishment of the breeding season in many species around the world."},{"__component":"lesson-plan.section-heading","id":4,"SectionTitle":"Standards"},{"__component":"lesson-plan.steam-badge","id":1,"Title":"About the GP Learning Chart","Description":"This Galactic Polymath Learning Chart illustrates the areas of knowledge covered.
